Welcome to the Mind Games Project!
The project consists of four games:
1) "Is it an even number?" - In this game you need to specify whether the number is even or not.
2) "Calculator" - in this game you have to solve a simple expression of two numbers 
3) "Progression"- in this game you have to calculate the missing number of the progression
4) "Is it a prime number?" - in this game you need to specify whether the number is prime or not
5) "The greatest common divisor" - in this game you are given two numbers, you must calculate the greatest common denominator 

Each game has three questions, you need to answer all the questions correctly.


Install the game as follows, 
1) git clone https://github.com/2Fanik2/frontend-project-44.git
2) make install 

STARTING THE GAME:
1) "Is it an even number? - brain-even 
2) "Calculator" - brain-calc
3) "Progression"- brain-progression
4) "Is it a prime number?" - brain-prime
5) "The greatest common divisor" - brain-gcd
